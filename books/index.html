          The removal of disciminatory laws and extension of citizenship rights to non-citizens
generally reduces interethnic inequality, but legal equality alone is not a panacea; implicit biases and elite capture can prevent welfare gains even when the rights of marginalized
populations are expanded. In Latin America, the extension of legal equality to indigenous groups
had a paradoxical effect. In areas where the indigenous had achieved greater parity with the white
and mestizo population in the pre-reform period, interethnic inequality is now the highest.
Conversely, inequality is lowest where there was greater interethnic inequality in the pre-reform
period. <br><br>
This reversal in inequality trends can be observed through an examination of Peruvian
provinces over the past two centuries. In Peru (as well as Bolivia, Ecuador, Central America, and
southern Mexico), ethnic and class cleavages are often overlapping; the indigenous tend to be
peasants and the white/mestizo population tend to be landowners or middle-class townspeople. Using per capita income data
disaggregated by ethnicity from the pre-reform period, we can observe how interethnic inequality
has changed over time. Lacking a contemporary measure of income disaggegated by ethnicity, I
instead use 2007 literacy rates, a basic measure of development and also of the provision of a
basic government service—education. Comparing 1827 interethnic income inequality with 2007
interethnic differences in literacy rates, we observe a relatively strong negative correlation. Where the indigenous achieved greater equality in 1827—just a few years after independence
was achieved—they are now the most unequal on a fundamental measure of development.
What accounts for these opposing development trajectories? I argue that the original
expansion of liberal citizenship in the developing world involved not just an extension of
additional rights to marginalized populations, but also the erosion of colonial-era land-for-tax
pacts. <br><br>
          Under these pacts, marginalized peasant “subjects” paid a tribute or tax to the colonial government in 
 exchange for protection of their land from encroachment by large landowners. When these taxes were revoked (i.e., 1854 in Peru) and the
tax code was made to apply equally to all citizens, central governments abandoned the protection
of peasant land, which allowed for annexation by aggressive landlords. Where peasant
productivity was relatively high compared to landowners (i.e., low inequality), peasant land and
labor were more likely to be subsumed into large estates. The resulting quasi-feudal,
labor-repressive arrangements wiped out the past development gains of the peasantry and
benefited the landowning class, resulting in a long-term increase in inequality.
Conversely, where inequality was high prior to legal equality, the value of peasant land was less.
The removal of government protection resulted in less encroachment by the landed elite. In Latin
America, peasants in these areas preserved communal landholding arrangements, which in the long-term, served as 
a valuable source of collective action to lobby for and build public works,
thereby reducing inequality.
