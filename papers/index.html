         <p><font size="2"> Why do some indigenous communities experience assimilation while others obtain government protection for their longstanding institutions and cultures? I argue that historical experiences with labor extraction play a key role. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Latin American governments enacted discriminatory policies that conscripted unpaid indigenous labor to build roads and railways. Communities exposed to this extraction faced a common enemy, increasing collective action capacity within and across communities. Over time, this ability to collectively mobilize endured and enabled native groups to obtain more substantial government protections for their institutions and cultures. I test this argument using an original natural experiment in which communities’ exposure to unpaid labor conscription on a 1920s Peruvian highway was as-if randomly assigned. I combine this design with historical data on indigenous rebellions and community-level collective action, as well as contemporary data on community conflict with outsiders, language survival, and the persistence of indigenous institutions. The theory and evidence shed new light on the long-term effects of discriminatory policies on indigenous groups’ political power.

        <p><font size="2">Why do some indigenous groups achieve coethnic political representation while others
do not? In this paper, I highlight the primary role of communal property in shaping indigenous representation. While scholars often laud the developmental benefits
of communal land titling, I argue that formalizing collectively held land can inhibit
indigenous coordination to achieve political representation. Where communal land is
informally held, indigenous groups are more likely to invest in traditional institutions
that facilitate collective action to elect coethnic candidates to political office. Conversely, titling communal property secures indigenous land access but in the process
erodes traditional institutions that would otherwise promote collective action during
elections. I test my argument using a multi-method approach that includes interviews
and experiments with three-hundred Peruvian indigenous leaders, historical land-title
data, and information scraped from mayoral candidate CVs. The findings suggest that
the oft-cited economic benefits of collective property may generate negative political
effects.

          The Uneven Reach of Schools: Ethnicity and Education Provision in Nineteenth-Century Latin America.
          <details> <summary>
<a class="btnfire small stroke"><em class="fas fa-chevron-circle-down"></em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstract</a>    
</summary>
     <p><font size="2">   A well-established political economy literature predicts a positive relationship between ethnic homogeneity and public goods provision. Yet, the initial phase of education provision in nineteenth-century Latin America benefited ethnically heterogeneous, rather than homogeneous, areas. This article explores this unexpected finding, highlighting the central role of longstanding norms around regressive, ethnic-based taxation, which redistributed wealth from marginalized indigenous groups to a non-indigenous political and economic elite. Employing case studies, archival data, and a natural experiment from Peru, I show that non-indigenous political elites provided education most broadly in heterogeneous areas in which there existed both a coethnic demand for education <i> and</i> a large indigenous tax base that could be exploited to meet this demand. By contrast, in homogeneous indigenous areas, the non-indigenous elite did not expand education beyond their very narrow base of co-ethnics, resulting in an overall limited provision of primary schools. Finally, in homogeneous non-indigenous areas, where there existed no indigenous tax base, the political elite was reluctant to violate longstanding norms by levying taxes on coethnic white and <i>mestizo</i> citizens. Only under conditions of intra-elite competition did these politicians incur the norms-violating cost of taxing coethnics and thereby, expand primary education. This early and unequal expansion of primary education had long-term implications for interethnic inequality in the region.
