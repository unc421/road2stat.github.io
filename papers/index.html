          Did early education expansion reinforce interethnic inequality? Evidence from Nineteenth-Century Latin America.

          How did the earliest phase of education expansion shape interethnic inequality in Latin America? This paper argues that in delegating responsibility for education to majority white and mestizo municipal councils, central governments in Latin America functionally assured interethnic inequality in education access. Yet, the manner in which this inequality was created varied depending on the ethnic composition of municipalities. Particularly determinative was the way education was financed. In heterogeneous municipalities, local government officials extracted wealth from indigenous communities to provide education selectively to their non-indigenous coethnics. In homogeneous indigenous municipalities, education provision was very low, as the non-indigenous governing elite had no incentive to expand schooling beyond their small coethnic minority. And in homogeneous non-indigenous municipalities education provision was likewise low, except when intra-elite competition encouraged the non-indigenous political elite to incur the cost of taxing their coethnics. I test this argument using descriptive data, a natural experiment from nineteenth-century Peru, and case studies from Peru and Mexico.

          Communal Landholding and the Coordination of Ethnic Voting: Evidence from Mexico and Peru.
          <details> <summary>

          Public goods are often allocated along ethnic lines in heterogeneous societies. However, variation exists in the extent to which one 
            ethnic group controls resources as opposed to another. In this paper, I use the cases of Peru and Mexico to explore the conditions under 
            which indigenous citizens elect coethnic leaders and how the election of such candidates affects the distribution of 
            public goods provided across ethnic groups. I argue that where communal landholding institutions, which tend to have a 
            mostly indigenous membership, have persisted, differences in development outcomes between indigenous and non-indigenous 
            populations are greatly reduced. Such a reduction is largely due to the the fact that communities solve coordination problems, 
            allowing indigenous voters to support a single indigenous candidate, who, when victorious, rewards communities with public goods.
            Using data from a conjoint experiment, lab-in-the-field, and a natural experiment, I provide evidence to show that 1) a 
            candidateâ€™s community membership is an important determinant of whether she receives the support of community members; 2) that 
            trust in the candidate is a key mechanism in explaining this preference; and 3) that mayors who are community members reward 
            communities with more public goods than mayors who are not from communities.
