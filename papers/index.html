        <p><font size="0.5">When are indigenous groups granted political authority over the lands they occupy? 
            And how does receiving this concession from central states affect long-term political 
            representation and welfare outcomes? Scholars in political science and related disciplines 
            have often highlighted the primacy of indigenous demands for indigenous territorial authority---here 
            defined as the legal right of native populations to exercise control over a geographically delimited 
            space, or "territory." Yet, why do states offer this authority, why do indigenous groups sometimes 
            reject it---which they do---and what are the long-term effects of these extensions of authority for 
            collective action and welfare? I theorize how the goals and motivations around resource extraction shape 
            the decision of the central state to offer territorial authority as well as the choice by indigenous 
            groups to resist or embrace it. Under divided extraction---where private elites extract beyond the 
            preferences of the central government due to ideological or political differences---both the central 
            state and indigenous groups have an incentive to bolster territorial authority. Under unified 
            extraction---where private actors extract in a manner consistent with the central government's 
            preferences---central states either undermine territorial authority or impose a weak form of 
            territorial authority that is subsequently resisted by indigenous groups. I then argue that 
            the conditions that give rise to territorial authority also shape its political and social effects. 
            Under divided extraction, the central state offers a "consolidated" form of territorial authority 
            that maximizes indigenous groups' collective action capacity, which can then be mobilized to elect 
            indigenous politicians and obtain public goods. Under unified extraction, however, governments create 
            a "fragmented" form of territorial authority, which reduces indigenous groups' collective action 
            capacity, reducing their political representation and access to public benefits. Empirically, I 
            adopt a multi-method approach that draws on archival data, historical natural experiments, a robust 
            interdisciplinary literature on indigenous politics, original surveys and experiments, extensive 
            fieldwork in indigenous communities, and over one hundred interviews with mayors, bureaucrats, and 
            indigenous authorities.

          Divided Extraction, Consolidated Authority: Indigenous Territorial Governance in the Americas.
          <details> <summary>

</summary>
          Since the onset of European colonization, indigenous groups in the Americas have experienced near-constant extraction of their land, labor, and capital. Yet, we know little about how this extraction has shaped the ability of native populations to achieve their central demand of greater ``territorial authority''---the legal right of indigenous groups to exercise control over a geographically delimited space, or territory. I develop a theory that disaggregates extraction into two types, which have distinct and opposing effects on territorial authority. Alignment between the central state and local elites produces a unified form of extraction that either reduces territorial authority or generates a weak form of ``fragmented'' territorial authority, which indigenous groups resist. In contrast, divided extraction, where local elites extract against the preferences of the central state, gives rise to a robust form of ``consolidated'' territorial authority, which indigenous groups generally embrace. I explore these divergent effects of extraction using two historical natural experiments from Peru and the United States. I show that unified extraction under a 1920s-era Peruvian labor conscription program led to fragmented territorial authority. I then demonstrate that divided extraction of reservation land following the 1934 repeal of the United States Dawes Act generated a consolidated form of territorial authority. I further exploit within-case variation to show that periods of divided extraction in Peru and unified extraction in the United States conform to the predictions of my theory.

         The Divergent Effects of Indigenous Authority: Evidence from Peru
          <details> <summary>
<a class="btnfire small stroke"><em class="fas fa-chevron-circle-down"></em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstract</a>    
</summary>
        Across a number of contexts, scholars have observed opposing distributive effects of granting indigenous groups' political control over territory, or ``territorial authority.'' This paper provides a theoretical framework for reconciling these divergent findings.  I argue that ``exchange-based'' territorial authority arrangements, which emerge from a constantly renewing bargain between indigenous groups and the state, reinforce traditional institutions of reciprocity that coordinate native populations to achieve both subnational political representation and greater access to distributive benefits. Conversely, ``title-based'' authority arrangements, which are granted through a one-time extension of a communal land title, are more likely to erode reciprocity institutions, thereby thwarting collective political mobilization and access to distributive benefits. I explore this argument through an analysis of Peru and its central institution of territorial authority: the indigenous community. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, lab-in-the-field and conjoint experiments with over three hundred indigenous community presidents, and an instrumental-variables analysis of sixteenth-century data on disease and land title, I demonstrate that exchange-based forms of territorial authority preserve traditional reciprocity institutions and facilitate gains in both indigenous political representation and access to government-provided distributive benefits. Title-based forms of territorial authority have the opposite effects.

          Unlikely Beneficiaries: Indigenous Groups and Education Provision in the Nineteenth-Century Americas
          <details> <summary>
<a class="btnfire small stroke"><em class="fas fa-chevron-circle-down"></em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstract</a>    
</summary>
        When do politically excluded populations receive access to public goods? Indigenous groups in the Americas have 
            long experienced significant political and economic marginalization. Yet, these groups have at times obtained public 
            benefits from the government. The nineteenth-century expansion of primary education to certain native populations 
            provides a particular puzzle as it seems an unlikely outcome: non-indigenous groups held a near monopoly on political 
            power, and the curriculum in primary schools often focused on a nation-building goal that entirely excluded indigenous 
            populations. This article explores why some indigenous groups benefited from this early expansion of primary education. 
            I argue that two conditions were jointly necessary. First, indigenous groups needed the capacity to act collectively to pressure government officials; 
            communal landholding institutions proved essential in creating and reinforcing this capacity. Second, indigenous groups needed the opportunity 
            space for collective action to be effective; divisions within the non-indigenous elite created such a space. I examine this 
            argument using a natural experiment from nineteenth-century Peru using as-if random variation in indigenous groups' exposure to 
            local-level, intra-elite conflict. Consistent with the theory, I show that this conflict increased education provision to indigenous 
            groups but only when those groups were organized into communal landholding institutions. I then trace the long-term welfare effects of 
            this early period of education provision. In addition to this evidence from Peru, I explore case studies of primary education expansion in nineteenth- 
            and early twentieth-century Bolivia, the United States, and Mexico.
