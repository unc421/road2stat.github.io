        <p><font size="2">Indigenous territorial authority, whereby states grant a legal right to indigenous groups to govern the lands they occupy, presents a series of puzzles. Why would a Weberian central state, which is interested in monopolizing control over territory, cede power to a politically and economically marginalized native population? Why would indigenous groups embrace offers of territorial authority from the central state, a historically non-credible partner? And why have indigenous territorial authority arrangements had such markedly different political and social effects both within and across countries? This book develops and tests an argument to answer these questions.

From the arrival of the first European settlers, indigenous groups in the Americas have experienced near-constant extraction of their land, labor, and capital, but they have also sometimes been offered greater autonomy over their local affairs. This dissertation explores the emergence and effects of indigenous autonomy. I investigate three central questions. Why do central states grant indigenous autonomy in some cases and not others? Why do native communities sometimes embrace government offers of autonomy and sometimes resist? And how does autonomy shape indigenous groups' long-term access to political representation? To answer these questions, I develop a theory that emphasizes the central explanatory role of resource extraction by state and private actors.

In a first section of the dissertation, I examine the decision by central states to grant indigenous autonomy. I argue that individual incumbents recognize autonomy when two conditions jointly obtain. First, national-level incumbents must view indigenous elites as strategic partners in achieving their central goal of remaining in power; this provides an incentive for incumbents to recognize autonomy. Second, rural elites, who view autonomy as a barrier to their extraction of indigenous land and labor, must be sufficently weak that they cannot block incumbents from recognizing indigenous autonomy. Once incumbents decide to grant autonomy, the specific form it takes---political or economic---depends on the relative value of indigenous factor endowments. To test this argument, I employ a series of historical and contemporary case studies from the Americas.

In a second section of the dissertation, I examine a key puzzle around indigenous community responses to autonomy. Scholars often argue that autonomy is the central demand of native groups. Yet, in a number of historical and contemporary cases, individual indigenous communities within a given country have resisted central state offers of greater autonomy. I argue that the decision of indigenous groups to embrace or resist autonomy arises from prior experiences with extraction, which may vary across native communities within the same country. Exposure to extraction by the central state generally leads indigenous communities to resist autonomy. Conversely, exposure to extraction by rural elites increases the likelihood that native communities embrace autonomy. I evaluate this argument using historical natural experiments from Peru and the United States, along with survey data and case studies from Bolivia.   

In a final section of the dissertation, I examine how autonomy affects indigenous groups' representation within the state. I argue that economic autonomy undermines indigenous institutions and thereby reduces coordination to achieve political representation. I then argue that political autonomy often lumps disparate indigenous communities together, generating conflict and also undermining native groups' access to political representation. Granting both political and economic autonomy, on the other hand, may increase indigenous groups' access to political representation. I evaluate this argument using archival data, original surveys and experiments with indigenous elites, and natural experiments. 

This dissertation develops and tests a theory that seeks to bridge historical and contemporary research on indigenous-state relations in the Americas. As such, it makes several distinct theoretical and substantive contributions. First, it highlights the key role of intra-elite conflict in shaping the decision of central states to extend indigenous autonomy. Second, it builds on a body of work in historical political economy that highlights the key role of extraction and factor endowments in shaping the long-term welfare of indigenous groups. Finally, the project highlights a number of important yet often understudied costs that may arise from autonomy. As I show in the different sections of the dissertation, autonomy may carry benefits for indigenous communities, but it may also increase their vulnerability to extraction by non-indigenous actors and reduce their long-term access to descriptive and substantive political representation.

          <a> Divided Extraction, Consolidated Authority: Indigenous Territorial Governance in the Americas</a>.

         <p><font size="2"> Since the onset of European colonization, indigenous groups in the Americas have experienced near-constant extraction of their land, labor, and capital. Yet, we know little about how this extraction has shaped the ability of native populations to achieve their central demand of greater ``territorial authority''---the legal right of indigenous groups to exercise control over a geographically delimited space, or territory. I develop a theory that disaggregates extraction into two types, which have distinct and opposing effects on territorial authority. Alignment between the central state and local elites produces a unified form of extraction that either reduces territorial authority or generates a weak form of ``fragmented'' territorial authority, which indigenous groups resist. In contrast, divided extraction, where local elites extract against the preferences of the central state, gives rise to a robust form of ``consolidated'' territorial authority, which indigenous groups generally embrace. I explore these divergent effects of extraction using two historical natural experiments from Peru and the United States. I show that unified extraction under a 1920s-era Peruvian labor conscription program led to fragmented territorial authority. I then demonstrate that divided extraction of reservation land following the 1934 repeal of the United States Dawes Act generated a consolidated form of territorial authority. I further exploit within-case variation to show that periods of divided extraction in Peru and unified extraction in the United States conform to the predictions of my theory.

        <p><font size="2">The decision of central states to delegate political control over territory, or “territorial authority,” to indigenous groups may have countervailing welfare effects. Greater control over local affairs may come at the cost of less representation of native groups within the state and an accompanying decline in government-provided distributive benefits. This paper reconciles these opposing predictions. I argue that “exchange-based” authority arrangements, which emerge from a constantly renewing bargain between indigenous groups and the state, reinforce traditional institutions of reciprocity that coordinate native populations to achieve both subnational political representation and greater access to public goods. Conversely, “title-based” authority arrangements, which are granted through a one-time extension of communal land titles, often erode reciprocity institutions, thereby thwarting collective political mobilization and access to public goods. I explore this argument through an analysis of Peru and its central institution of territorial authority: the indigenous community. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, lab-in-the-field and conjoint experiments with over three hundred indigenous community presidents, and an instrumental-variables analysis of sixteenth-century data on disease and land titles, I demonstrate that exchange-based forms of territorial authority preserve traditional reciprocity institutions and facilitate gains in both indigenous political representation and access to government-provided distributive benefits. Title-based forms of territorial authority have the opposite effects.

          The Uneven Reach of Schools: Ethnicity and Education Provision in Nineteenth-Century Latin America.
          <details> <summary>
<a class="btnfire small stroke"><em class="fas fa-chevron-circle-down"></em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstract</a>

     <p><font size="2">   A well-established political economy literature predicts a positive relationship between ethnic homogeneity and public goods provision. Yet, the initial phase of education provision in nineteenth-century Latin America benefited ethnically heterogeneous, rather than homogeneous, areas. This article explores this unexpected finding, highlighting the central role of longstanding norms around regressive, ethnic-based taxation, which redistributed wealth from marginalized indigenous groups to a non-indigenous political and economic elite. Employing case studies, archival data, and a natural experiment from Peru, I show that non-indigenous political elites provided education most broadly in heterogeneous areas in which there existed both a coethnic demand for education <i> and</i> a large indigenous tax base that could be exploited to meet this demand. By contrast, in homogeneous indigenous areas, the non-indigenous elite did not expand education beyond their very narrow base of co-ethnics, resulting in an overall limited provision of primary schools. Finally, in homogeneous non-indigenous areas, where there existed no indigenous tax base, the political elite was reluctant to violate longstanding norms by levying taxes on coethnic white and <i>mestizo</i> citizens. Only under conditions of intra-elite competition did these politicians incur the norms-violating cost of taxing coethnics and thereby, expand primary education. This early and unequal expansion of primary education had long-term implications for interethnic inequality in the region.
