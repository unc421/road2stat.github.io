        When are indigenous groups granted political authority over the lands they occupy? 
            And how does receiving this concession from central states affect long-term political 
            representation and welfare outcomes? Scholars in political science and related disciplines 
            have often highlighted the primacy of indigenous demands for indigenous territorial authority---here 
            defined as the legal right of native populations to exercise control over a geographically delimited 
            space, or ``territory.'' Yet, why do states offer this authority, why do indigenous groups sometimes 
            reject it---which they do---and what are the long-term effects of these extensions of authority for 
            collective action and welfare? I theorize how the goals and motivations around resource extraction shape 
            the decision of the central state to offer territorial authority as well as the choice by indigenous 
            groups to resist or embrace it. Under divided extraction---where private elites extract beyond the 
            preferences of the central government due to ideological or political differences---both the central 
            state and indigenous groups have an incentive to bolster territorial authority. Under unified 
            extraction---where private actors extract in a manner consistent with the central government's 
            preferences---central states either undermine territorial authority or impose a weak form of 
            territorial authority that is subsequently resisted by indigenous groups. I then argue that 
            the conditions that give rise to territorial authority also shape its political and social effects. 
            Under divided extraction, the central state offers a ``consolidated'' form of territorial authority 
            that maximizes indigenous groups' collective action capacity, which can then be mobilized to elect 
            indigenous politicians and obtain public goods. Under unified extraction, however, governments create 
            a ``fragmented'' form of territorial authority, which reduces indigenous groups' collective action 
            capacity, reducing their political representation and access to public benefits. Empirically, I 
            adopt a multi-method approach that draws on archival data, historical natural experiments, a robust 
            interdisciplinary literature on indigenous politics, original surveys and experiments, extensive 
            fieldwork in indigenous communities, and over one hundred interviews with mayors, bureaucrats, and 
            indigenous authorities.

          States of Extraction: The Creation of Indigenous Territorial Authority in the Americas.

         When are indigenous groups granted political authority over the lands they occupy? This article explores 
            variation in both state supply and indigenous demand for ``territorial authority''---here defined as the 
            legal right of native populations to exercise control over a geographically delimited space, or territory. 
            I argue that expansions and reductions of indigenous territorial authority emerge as a strategic response 
            from both central states and indigenous groups to the prevailing form of extraction of indigenous groups' 
            land, labor, and capital. \emph{Unified} extraction, which involves coordination between the central state 
            and local elite, reduces indigenous territorial authority when land is extracted and leads states to impose 
            a ``weak'' form of territorial authority when labor or capital is extracted; indigenous groups resist either 
            option. Conversely, \emph{divided} extraction, under which a local elite extracts beyond what the central 
            state prefers, may give rise to a more robust form of territorial authority, which indigenous groups 
            generally embrace. To evaluate this argument, I first use archival data and a historical natural experiment 
            from Peru to show that divided extraction under the indigenous head tax increased territorial authority while 
            unified extraction under a labor conscription program advanced a more limited territorial authority, which 
            indigenous groups then resisted. I then leverage a natural experiment from the United States to show that 
            unified extraction of indigenous land under the Dawes Act reduced territorial authority while a subsequent 
            period of divided extraction beginning in 1934 increased it.

          More Autonomy and Fewer Resources? Indigenous Authority and Public Goods Provision in Contemporary Latin America
          <details> <summary>
<a class="btnfire small stroke"><em class="fas fa-chevron-circle-down"></em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstract</a>    
</summary>
        Indigenous groups in the Americas have long demanded the right to exercise political authority over the territories they occupy. Yet, the extension of this ``territorial authority'' may also rupture native groups' ties to the state, thereby reducing their access to government-provided goods and services. This article investigates whether the extension of territorial authority has in fact curtailed indigenous groups' ability to lobby for state resources. I argue that, rather than breaking linkages with the government, territorial authority can \emph{increase} indigenous groups' political representation, which in turn \emph{expands} their access to public goods and services. Territorial authority preserves traditional norms and institutions that solve coordination problems and facilitate collective mobilization within and across indigenous groups. This mobilization can be deployed to elect indigenous officials to subnational or national-level posts. I test this theory using ethnographic fieldwork, along with experiments embedded in a survey with over three hundred current and former presidents of Peruvian indigenous \emph{comunidades}, or communities. I find that the recognition of these communities, which are spaces where territorial authority is exercised, preserve longstanding norms of reciprocity that enable intra-group coordination to elect indigenous candidates to positions in local government. I then use a regression kink design to show that, when elected, indigenous subnational officials reward indigenous communities with public goods, which themselves are provided using traditional institutions of volunteer, communal labor. Importantly, these findings only emerge under ``consolidated'' territorial authority. When governments seek to prevent this collective mobilization by indigenous groups, they design and offer a form of ``fragmented'' territorial authority, which redefines community borders to either divide cohesive groups or combine groups prone to conflict. These arrangements thwart collective action and prevent the aforementioned public goods gains from territorial authority.

          Unlikely Beneficiaries: Indigenous Groups and Education Provision in the Nineteenth-Century Americas
          <details> <summary>
<a class="btnfire small stroke"><em class="fas fa-chevron-circle-down"></em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstract</a>

        When do politically excluded populations receive access to public goods? Indigenous groups in the Americas have long experienced significant political and economic marginalization. Yet, these groups have at times obtained public benefits from the government. The nineteenth-century expansion of primary education to certain native populations provides a particular puzzle as it seems an unlikely outcome: non-indigenous groups held a near monopoly on political power, and the curriculum in primary schools often focused on a nation-building goal that entirely excluded indigenous populations. This article explores why some indigenous groups benefited from this early expansion of primary education. I argue that two conditions were jointly necessary. First, indigenous groups needed the \emph{capacity} to act collectively to pressure government officials; communal landholding institutions proved essential in creating and reinforcing this capacity. Second, indigenous groups needed the \emph{opportunity space} for collective action to be effective; divisions within the non-indigenous elite created such a space. I examine this argument using a natural experiment from nineteenth-century Peru using as-if random variation in indigenous groups' exposure to local-level, intra-elite conflict. Consistent with the theory, I show that this conflict increased education provision to indigenous groups but only when those groups were organized into communal landholding institutions. I then trace the long-term welfare effects of this early period of education provision. In addition to this evidence from Peru, I explore case studies of primary education expansion in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Bolivia, the United States, and Mexico.
