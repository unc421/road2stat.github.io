        <p><font size="2">Indigenous territorial authority, whereby states grant a legal right to indigenous groups to govern the lands they occupy, presents a series of puzzles. Why would a Weberian central state, which is interested in monopolizing control over territory, cede power to a politically and economically marginalized native population? Why would indigenous groups embrace offers of territorial authority from the central state, a historically non-credible partner? And why have indigenous territorial authority arrangements had such markedly different political and social effects both within and across countries? This book develops and tests an argument to answer these questions.

I argue that different territorial authority arrangements emerge due to coalitional dynamics between the central state and a non-indigenous, rural elite that extracts indigenous land, labor, and capital. When this rural elite belongs to the governing coalition, their accumulation of indigenous group resources serves to bolster the incumbent regime. Central states thus facilitate this extraction by either undermining existing territorial authority arrangements or proposing a weak form of territorial authority, which indigenous groups subsequently resist. When the rural elite is excluded from the ruling coalition---due to ideological, partisan, or policy differences---their extraction of indigenous groups' land, labor, and capital poses a threat to the central state. In response, the incumbent government grants indigenous groups a robust form of territorial authority as protection against private predation, which native groups generally embrace. I further argue that these strong forms of territorial authority preserve important traditional institutions that facilitate long-term collective mobilization to achieve political representation and increased access to public goods. Indigenous groups do not experience these representational and distributive gains under weaker forms of territorial authority or where territorial authority is absent.

         <p><font size="2"> Since the onset of European colonization, indigenous groups in the Americas have experienced near-constant extraction of their land, labor, and capital. Yet, we know little about how this extraction has shaped the ability of native populations to achieve their central demand of greater ``territorial authority''---the legal right of indigenous groups to exercise control over a geographically delimited space, or territory. I develop a theory that disaggregates extraction into two types, which have distinct and opposing effects on territorial authority. Alignment between the central state and local elites produces a unified form of extraction that either reduces territorial authority or generates a weak form of ``fragmented'' territorial authority, which indigenous groups resist. In contrast, divided extraction, where local elites extract against the preferences of the central state, gives rise to a robust form of ``consolidated'' territorial authority, which indigenous groups generally embrace. I explore these divergent effects of extraction using two historical natural experiments from Peru and the United States. I show that unified extraction under a 1920s-era Peruvian labor conscription program led to fragmented territorial authority. I then demonstrate that divided extraction of reservation land following the 1934 repeal of the United States Dawes Act generated a consolidated form of territorial authority. I further exploit within-case variation to show that periods of divided extraction in Peru and unified extraction in the United States conform to the predictions of my theory.

        <p><font size="2">The decision of central states to delegate political control over territory, or “territorial authority,” to indigenous groups may have countervailing welfare effects. Greater control over local affairs may come at the cost of less representation of native groups within the state and an accompanying decline in government-provided distributive benefits. This paper reconciles these opposing predictions. I argue that “exchange-based” authority arrangements, which emerge from a constantly renewing bargain between indigenous groups and the state, reinforce traditional institutions of reciprocity that coordinate native populations to achieve both subnational political representation and greater access to public goods. Conversely, “title-based” authority arrangements, which are granted through a one-time extension of communal land titles, often erode reciprocity institutions, thereby thwarting collective political mobilization and access to public goods. I explore this argument through an analysis of Peru and its central institution of territorial authority: the indigenous community. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, lab-in-the-field and conjoint experiments with over three hundred indigenous community presidents, and an instrumental-variables analysis of sixteenth-century data on disease and land titles, I demonstrate that exchange-based forms of territorial authority preserve traditional reciprocity institutions and facilitate gains in both indigenous political representation and access to government-provided distributive benefits. Title-based forms of territorial authority have the opposite effects.

          The Uneven Reach of Schools: Ethnicity and Education Provision in Nineteenth-Century Latin America.
          <details> <summary>
<a class="btnfire small stroke"><em class="fas fa-chevron-circle-down"></em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstract</a>

     <p><font size="2">   A well-established political economy literature predicts a positive relationship between ethnic homogeneity and public goods provision. Yet, the initial phase of education provision in nineteenth-century Latin America benefited ethnically heterogeneous, rather than homogeneous, areas. This article explores this unexpected finding, highlighting the central role of longstanding norms around regressive, ethnic-based taxation, which redistributed wealth from marginalized indigenous groups to a non-indigenous political and economic elite. Employing case studies, archival data, and a natural experiment from Peru, I show that non-indigenous political elites provided education most broadly in heterogeneous areas in which there existed both a coethnic demand for education <i> and</i> a large indigenous tax base that could be exploited to meet this demand. By contrast, in homogeneous indigenous areas, the non-indigenous elite did not expand education beyond their very narrow base of co-ethnics, resulting in an overall limited provision of primary schools. Finally, in homogeneous non-indigenous areas, where there existed no indigenous tax base, the political elite was reluctant to violate longstanding norms by levying taxes on coethnic white and <i>mestizo</i> citizens. Only under conditions of intra-elite competition did these politicians incur the norms-violating cost of taxing coethnics and thereby, expand primary education. This early and unequal expansion of primary education had long-term implications for interethnic inequality in the region.
