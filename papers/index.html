From the arrival of the first European settlers, indigenous groups in the Americas have experienced near-constant extraction of their land, labor, and capital, but they have also sometimes been offered greater autonomy over their local affairs. This dissertation explores the emergence and effects of indigenous autonomy. I investigate three central questions. Why do central states grant indigenous autonomy in some cases and not others? Why do native communities sometimes embrace government offers of autonomy and sometimes resist? And how does autonomy shape indigenous groups' long-term access to political representation? To answer these questions, I develop a theory that emphasizes the central explanatory role of resource extraction by state and private actors.

In a first section of the dissertation, I examine the decision by central states to grant indigenous autonomy. I argue that individual incumbents recognize autonomy when two conditions jointly obtain. First, national-level incumbents must view indigenous elites as strategic partners in achieving their central goal of remaining in power; this provides an incentive for incumbents to recognize autonomy. Second, rural elites, who view autonomy as a barrier to their extraction of indigenous land and labor, must be sufficently weak that they cannot block incumbents from recognizing indigenous autonomy. Once incumbents decide to grant autonomy, the specific form it takes---political or economic---depends on the relative value of indigenous factor endowments. To test this argument, I employ a series of historical and contemporary case studies from the Americas.

In a second section of the dissertation, I examine a key puzzle around indigenous community responses to autonomy. Scholars often argue that autonomy is the central demand of native groups. Yet, in a number of historical and contemporary cases, individual indigenous communities within a given country have resisted central state offers of greater autonomy. I argue that the decision of indigenous groups to embrace or resist autonomy arises from prior experiences with extraction, which may vary across native communities within the same country. Exposure to extraction by the central state generally leads indigenous communities to resist autonomy. Conversely, exposure to extraction by rural elites increases the likelihood that native communities embrace autonomy. I evaluate this argument using historical natural experiments from Peru and the United States, along with survey data and case studies from Bolivia.   

In a final section of the dissertation, I examine how autonomy affects indigenous groups' representation within the state. I argue that economic autonomy undermines indigenous institutions and thereby reduces coordination to achieve political representation. I then argue that political autonomy often lumps disparate indigenous communities together, generating conflict and also undermining native groups' access to political representation. Granting both political and economic autonomy, on the other hand, may increase indigenous groups' access to political representation. I evaluate this argument using archival data, original surveys and experiments with indigenous elites, and natural experiments. 

This dissertation develops and tests a theory that seeks to bridge historical and contemporary research on indigenous-state relations in the Americas. As such, it makes several distinct theoretical and substantive contributions. First, it highlights the key role of intra-elite conflict in shaping the decision of central states to extend indigenous autonomy. Second, it builds on a body of work in historical political economy that highlights the key role of extraction and factor endowments in shaping the long-term welfare of indigenous groups. Finally, the project highlights a number of important yet often understudied costs that may arise from autonomy. As I show in the different sections of the dissertation, autonomy may carry benefits for indigenous communities, but it may also increase their vulnerability to extraction by non-indigenous actors and reduce their long-term access to descriptive and substantive political representation.

         <p><font size="2"> Why do some indigenous communities experience assimilation while others obtain government protection for their longstanding institutions and cultures? I argue that historical experiences with labor extraction play a key role. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Latin American governments enacted discriminatory policies that conscripted unpaid indigenous labor to build roads and railways. Communities exposed to this extraction faced a common enemy, increasing collective action capacity within and across communities. Over time, this ability to collectively mobilize endured and enabled native groups to obtain more substantial government protections for their institutions and cultures. I test this argument using an original natural experiment in which communities’ exposure to unpaid labor conscription on a 1920s Peruvian highway was as-if randomly assigned. I combine this design with historical data on indigenous rebellions and community-level collective action, as well as contemporary data on community conflict with outsiders, language survival, and the persistence of indigenous institutions. The theory and evidence shed new light on the long-term effects of discriminatory policies on indigenous groups’ political power.

        <p><font size="2">Why do some indigenous groups achieve coethnic political representation while others
do not? In this paper, I highlight the primary role of communal property in shaping indigenous representation. While scholars often laud the developmental benefits
of communal land titling, I argue that formalizing collectively held land can inhibit
indigenous coordination to achieve political representation. Where communal land is
informally held, indigenous groups are more likely to invest in traditional institutions
that facilitate collective action to elect coethnic candidates to political office. Conversely, titling communal property secures indigenous land access but in the process
erodes traditional institutions that would otherwise promote collective action during
elections. I test my argument using a multi-method approach that includes interviews
and experiments with three-hundred Peruvian indigenous leaders, historical land-title
data, and information scraped from mayoral candidate CVs. The findings suggest that
the oft-cited economic benefits of collective property may generate negative political
effects.

          The Uneven Reach of Schools: Ethnicity and Education Provision in Nineteenth-Century Latin America.

     <p><font size="2">   A well-established political economy literature predicts a positive relationship between ethnic homogeneity and public goods provision. Yet, the initial phase of education provision in nineteenth-century Latin America benefited ethnically heterogeneous, rather than homogeneous, areas. This article explores this unexpected finding, highlighting the central role of longstanding norms around regressive, ethnic-based taxation, which redistributed wealth from marginalized indigenous groups to a non-indigenous political and economic elite. Employing case studies, archival data, and a natural experiment from Peru, I show that non-indigenous political elites provided education most broadly in heterogeneous areas in which there existed both a coethnic demand for education <i> and</i> a large indigenous tax base that could be exploited to meet this demand. By contrast, in homogeneous indigenous areas, the non-indigenous elite did not expand education beyond their very narrow base of co-ethnics, resulting in an overall limited provision of primary schools. Finally, in homogeneous non-indigenous areas, where there existed no indigenous tax base, the political elite was reluctant to violate longstanding norms by levying taxes on coethnic white and <i>mestizo</i> citizens. Only under conditions of intra-elite competition did these politicians incur the norms-violating cost of taxing coethnics and thereby, expand primary education. This early and unequal expansion of primary education had long-term implications for interethnic inequality in the region.
